[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findastra_camera_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "astra_camera_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "astra_camera_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    astra_camera_msgsConfig.cmake
    astra_camera_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "astra_camera_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "astra_camera_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "astra_camera_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
