[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (JPEG) does
  not match the name of the calling package (JpegPkg).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/local/lib/cmake/libuvc/FindJpegPkg.cmake:58 (find_package_handle_standard_args)

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findserial.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "serial", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "serial" with any
  of the following names:

    serialConfig.cmake
    serial-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "serial" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "serial_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "serial"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
